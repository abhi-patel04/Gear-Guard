    Equipment Model
    
    🔍 PURPOSE:
    Represents a physical asset that needs maintenance.
    Examples: Laptops, machines, vehicles, printers, HVAC units
    
    🔍 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
    - Company has 50 laptops
    - Each laptop is an Equipment object
    - Laptop #123 breaks → Create MaintenanceRequest for Equipment #123
    - Equipment #123 is assigned to "IT Support Team"
    - When creating request, system auto-fills team from equipment
    
    🔍 HOW IT'S USED:
    - Equipment list page shows all equipment
    - Equipment detail page shows equipment info + related requests
    - When creating maintenance request, user selects equipment
    - System auto-assigns maintenance team from equipment
    - "Scrap" status disables equipment (can't create new requests)
